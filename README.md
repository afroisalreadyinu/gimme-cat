gimme-cat
=========

Elisp snippet to give you a cat picture in Emacs. Put the file
gimme-cat.el somewhere on your elisp path or copy the contents into
your .emacs file. Then bind the command gimme-cat to a key, as
follows:

    (global-set-key "\C-c\k" 'gimme-cat)

And now enjoy kittens in Emacs. Images can be displayed only with
Emacs versions capable of windowing, btw (so not on the command line).
